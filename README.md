# midtermReview

This github repository was meant as a _supplemental_ midterm review for CS 260. Don't let it replace
your own study. This review will go over concepts from class, but not projects. The midterm will include
questions about the lab, so the primary place to be studying is in the labs you've already made. Ask
yourself, "Do I actually understand what's going on in the labs I wrote". If not, You might want to look
that over first. If you don't understand something from the labs, stackoverflow and the TAs are very
happy to help.

If you've gone over your labs once, or maybe even twice, and you feel like you understand it, but would
like a little bit more background, this is the perfect resource for you. Read on!
